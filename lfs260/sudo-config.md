# Exercise 1.1: Configuring the System for sudo

It is very dangerous to run a root shell unless absolutely necessary: a single typo or other mistake can cause serious (even fatal) damage.
Thus, the sensible procedure is to configure things such that single commands may be run with superuser privilege, by using
the sudo mechanism. *With sudo the user only needs to know their own password and never needs to know the root password.*
If you are using a distribution such as Ubuntu, you may not need to do this lab to get sudo configured properly for the course.
However, you should still make sure you understand the procedure.
To check if your system is already configured to let the user account you are using run sudo, just do a simple command like:

```bash
$ sudo ls
```

You should be prompted for your user password and then the command should execute. If instead, you get an error message
you need to execute the following procedure.
Launch a root shell by typing su and then giving the root password, not your user password.

On all recent Linux distributions you should navigate to the */etc/sudoers.d subdirectory and create a file*, usually with the
name of the user to whom root wishes to grant sudo access. However, this convention is not actually necessary as sudo will
scan all files in this directory as needed. The file can simply contain:
```bash
# sudoers.d/student syntax
student ALL=(ALL) ALL
```
if the user is student.
An older practice (which certainly still works) is to add such a line at the end of the file /etc/sudoers. It is best to do so using
the *visudo* program, which is careful about making sure you use the right syntax in your edit.

```bash
# visudo command
$ visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/student
```

You probably also need to set proper permissions on the file by typing:

```bash
# (Note some Linux distributions may require 400 instead of 440 for the permissions.)
$ sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/student
```

After you have done these steps, exit the root shell by typing exit and then try to do sudo ls again.
There are many other ways an administrator can configure sudo, including specifying only certain permissions for certain
users, limiting searched paths etc. The /etc/sudoers file is very well self-documented.
However, there is one more setting we highly recommend you do, even if your system already has sudo configured. Most
distributions establish a different path for finding executables for normal users as compared to root users. In particular the
directories /sbin and /usr/sbin are not searched, *since sudo inherits the PATH of the user, not the full root user.*
Thus, in this course we would have to be constantly reminding you of the full path to many system administration utilities;
any enhancement to security is probably not worth the extra typing and figuring out which directories these programs are in.

Consequently, we suggest you add the following line to the .bashrc file in your home directory:
PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin:/sbin

If you log out and then log in again (you don’t have to reboot) this will be fully effective.
